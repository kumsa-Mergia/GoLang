## Introduction

Go, also known as Golang, is a fast, efficient, and statically typed language built by Google. It’s especially popular in cloud computing, networking, and distributed systems. This repository serves as a personal reference and record of progress as I learn Go from the basics to more advanced concepts.
Learning Goals

Here are the main topics I aim to cover in this repository:

- **Go Basics: Syntax, variables, loops, and conditionals**
- **Functions: Creating, using, and understanding Go functions**
- **Data Structures: Arrays, slices, maps, structs**
- **Concurrency: Goroutines and channels**
- **Error Handling: Idiomatic error handling in Go**
- **File Handling: Reading from and writing to files**
- **Project Work: Building small programs to apply concepts**

## Resources

I’m using a variety of resources to learn Go, including:

- **Go by Example**
- **The Go Programming Language Documentation**
- **Books: “The Go Programming Language” by Alan Donovan and Brian Kernighan**
